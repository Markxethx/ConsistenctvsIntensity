                <h1>Why Consistency is Better than Intensity?</h1>

                <aside class="quote"><q> <strong>Consistency</strong> create a stepping stone and it is the <strong>Intensity</strong> that creates an impact.</q></aside>
                <p>Knowing the difference between consistency and intensity is crucial when you are trying to reach a milestone on any route you are on. Especially if you are developing anything that may be related to a project for school, a career, a business, or your own personal agenda. To be consistent is like to boil water. Think about boiling a pot of water at a steady temperature for 10 minutes<i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i>. Do you think the water will boil? In so many ways the answer can be <strong>Yes</strong> but imagine the temperature is too low in a way that we can't even imagine it can boil water. The water almost leave the pot before it boils <i class="fa-solid fa-fire litte"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire litte"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire litte"></i>. Do you think the water will boil? The response is dependent on the fire's output temperature, therefore it will obviously take longer. Technically speaking, it is the Intensity that boils the water, intensity that is being created by the consistency.</p>
                <div class="quote2"><q><Strong>Consistency</strong> is the only way to get the water to boil, and <strong>Intensity</strong> only happen within the confines of consistency.</q></div>
                <p>Now, try to create <strong>Intensity</strong> alone, try to boil a water in a second using a very large amount of fire. <i class="fa-solid fa-fire larger"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire larger"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-fire larger"></i> It will not boil the water.</p>
                <br><p>Then why impact?</p><br> Now imagine there is an earthquake, the intensity is too strong even if it's just lasted a second. Was it an impact or just because we live in the society when houses are not capable to hadle the impact of an earthquake. If houses was built capable of handling strong earthquake we will not see it as an impact, doesn't matter how intense it is.</p>
                <p>Now imagine if the earthquake is consistent, this will bring an intensity.</p>
                <p>A similar phenomenon is happening with water; water has its own makeup and is unaffected by the high intensity that you apply in a second.</p>
